 </p>
</p>

## How many days it will run?

Bounty program will run for 2 weeks 

## How can I participate?

By signing up through the Typeform provided
https://7p712r2fvv9.typeform.com/to/lkVLiD3T  

## When will I start finding the bugs?

ArGo team will follow a first come first serve basis model, and they will send out Welcome email in batches, each batch will consist of a maximum 1000 participants. These participants will be able to highlight the bugs on GitHub.

So once you receive the Welcome email from the ArGo team, you can start finding the bugs. If participants outside of the batch raises any issues, they will not be entertained in the Bug Bounty Program.

## What will be the process of highlighting the bugs?

- Bug must be raised on GitHub by using the <raise issue tab>
- Please mark the <criticality> of the bug by labeling the issue with any of these low, high, critical
- If it's a UI related issue then developer must use ui-bug as label and issue type label use critical or high or low depending on the bug

There will be three types of bug that participants can find in the system:

- Critical: (bugs that can stop our entire system) - System Issue, Smart Contract Bug, Security Vulnerability, UI Crash, etc.
- High: (bugs that will not create any loss but improve the system) - Security Issues (but will not create that impact which critical can), System Issue (ex false data), Smart Contract Bug, UI issue (this will be bugs that will create a user confusion related to funds and other features)
- Low: (bugs that will not cause any big issue but itâ€™s good to have them rectified) - UI issues (ex formatting issues, component load issue, refresh issues), Security Issue 

## How much can I win as per the criticality level?
- Top 3 people who will find most critical issues, will be getting $500 each
